## Algebra: Quadratic Formula
To find the roots of ax^2 + bx + c = 0, use: x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.
Discriminant D = b^2 - 4ac. If D > 0, 2 real roots. If D = 0, 1 real root. If D < 0, complex roots.

## Probability: Bayes Theorem
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B).
Where P(A|B) is the probability of A given B is true.

## Calculus: Derivatives
d/dx(x^n) = n*x^(n-1)
d/dx(sin x) = cos x
d/dx(e^x) = e^x
d/dx(ln x) = 1/x

## Calculus: Integration
Integral of x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C (for n != -1)

## Linear Algebra: Determinants
For matrix [[a, b], [c, d]], determinant = ad - bc.
If det = 0, matrix is singular.

## Domain Constraints
- Denominators cannot be zero.
- Square roots of negative numbers are complex (not real).
- Probability must be between 0 and 1.
